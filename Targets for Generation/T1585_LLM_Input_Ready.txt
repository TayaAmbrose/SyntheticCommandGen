# Constraints
constraints = [
    "Commands must leverage Personal Account Development for creating or manipulating online personas and accounts.",
    "Ensure that Powershell commands utilize cmdlets specifically for account manipulation or querying APIs.",
    "Use Bash in Linux environments to interact directly with system utilities focusing on account creation and service interaction.",
    "In cloud platforms, use tools like boto3 for AWS and Azure CLI for Azure to manage cloud service accounts and permissions.",
    "Commands should focus on establishing persistent and believable personas for future operations which avoid detection.",
    "Avoid using tools or commands that are not documented or are less common as they can arouse suspicion or fail under scrutiny.",
    "Ensure that all tools and commands used are compatible with the specific shells and operating systems mentioned in the targets.",
    "Obfuscation methods such as base64 encoding in Powershell or using eval in Bash are recommended to disguise command origins or purposes.",
    "Commands should remain distinct and not overlap with Initial Access techniques, particularly phishing-based vectors.",
    "Output from commands should be in a format that supports automation and parsing, preferably JSON or XML where applicable."
