# Constraints
constraints = [
    "Commands must be executed within a PowerShell shell.",
    "Scripts like cscript, wscript, mshta, rundll32, or PubPrn.vbs should be leveraged to proxy execution of malicious files.",
    "Targets must be within a Windows platform environment as specified by the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1216.",
    "All commands and scripts should ensure they bypass application control systems.",
    "Malicious files or scripts executed must avoid detection by typical security mechanisms, suggesting potential use of obfuscation methods such as base64 encoding or the use of aliases.",
    "Commands should avoid functionality overlapping with other ATT&CK techniques to maintain the distinctiveness of T1216.",
    "Use of PowerShell is mandatory for the execution of the described scripts and utilities.",
    "Ensure the approach taken adheres strictly to system-level execution without the use of third-party tools, relying solely on native Windows script hosts and utilities.",
    "Monitor and analyze command-line parameters to flag unconventional uses of native tools indicative of proxy execution tactics.",
    "All interaction must respect the security and privilege context of the operation, differentiating between user and admin privilege requirements."
