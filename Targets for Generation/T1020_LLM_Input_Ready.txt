# Constraints
constraints = [
    "Each command must operate under shells limited to Bash, Powershell, or Python according to the available platforms.",
    "Commands specifically designed for exfiltration should avoid using common networking tools in ways that overlap with other ATT&CK techniques, particularly those not focusing on data exfiltration.",
    "Incorporate obfuscation methods where applicable, such as base64 encoding payloads to avoid detection by conventional security tools.",
    "Use realistic tooling such as 'scp', 'curl', or PowerShell cmdlets like 'Invoke-WebRequest', reflecting common practices for exfiltration.",
    "Ensure that commands are executable with the given privilege level; for example, system-level privileges may be required for certain exfiltration activities.",
    "Commands should be designed to silently perform actions without alerting system monitors or users to their presence on the system.",
    "Tool usage should seek to exploit features inherent to the tool's primary function to perform the exfiltration (e.g., using 'nc' or 'scp' for direct file transfers).",
    "Avoid redundant exfiltration by ensuring that scripts and command sequences are designed to uniquely handle data from gathering to transfer.",
    "Outputs should specifically exclude verbose or debug information to maximize stealth and efficiency during operation.",
    "Follow the guidance using technique ID T1020 as outlined by MITRE ATT&CK, adhering to structural and conceptual integrity."
