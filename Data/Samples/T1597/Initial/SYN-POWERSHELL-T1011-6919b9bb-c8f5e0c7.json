  "explanation": "Exfiltrates file content over ICMP on IPv6 using Nmap's nping, avoiding typical TCP/HTTP egress. The payload is Base64-encoded to make it less obvious in casual inspection, aligning with T1011 by using a different network medium (ICMP/IPv6) than standard channels.",

    "Read sensitive file and Base64-encode it for payload transport.",
    "Send a single ICMPv6 Echo with the encoded data as payload to a non-standard destination."
