  "explanation": "Exfiltrates a specific file over an alternate Wi\u2011Fi medium by disconnecting from any current Wi\u2011Fi, joining a covert 5 GHz SSID, base64-encoding the data, and sending it via IPv6 link-local to a high, uncommon port. This aligns with T1011 by shifting data transfer to a separate wireless medium from the presumed primary channel.",

    "Send the encoded data to an IPv6 link-local address scoped to en0 on a high, nonstandard port."
