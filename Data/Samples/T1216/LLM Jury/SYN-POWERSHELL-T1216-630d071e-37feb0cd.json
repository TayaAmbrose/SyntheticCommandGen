    "Parent process is powershell.exe running under a standard user context.",

    "A subsequent unexpected child process (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe, or rundll32.exe) spawns from cscript.exe.",
    "Event chain: powershell.exe -> cscript.exe -> PubPrn.vbs -> anomalous process indicates proxy execution."
