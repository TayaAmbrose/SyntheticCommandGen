  "explanation": "Uses an alternate Wi\u2011Fi SSID to exfiltrate a database dump via IPv6 UDP to a high, uncommon port, reducing overlap with typical monitored services. This leverages a different network medium than the primary channel, consistent with T1011.",

    "Drop any existing Wi\u2011Fi association.",
    "Join a non-corporate SSID on a less common 5 GHz channel.",
    "Base64-encode the dump to make payload less obvious in transit.",
    "Transmit via IPv6 UDP on a high port scoped to the Wi\u2011Fi interface."
