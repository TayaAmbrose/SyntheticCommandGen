    "From PowerShell, launch rundll32 with the javascript handler to reach MSHTML's RunHTMLApplication export.",
    "Within the JScript context, use GetObject with the script: moniker to fetch and execute a remote .sct scriptlet.",
    "Execution runs under user context and leverages trusted binaries, aiding control bypass and limiting detections to unusual parameter usage."
