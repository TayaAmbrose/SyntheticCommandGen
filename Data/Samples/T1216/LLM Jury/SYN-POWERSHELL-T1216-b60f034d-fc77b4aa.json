    "PowerShell starts a signed Windows script host (mshta.exe), creating a trusted parent-child chain",

    "Defenders should monitor PowerShell spawning mshta with network destinations and HTA file indicators",
    "Harden via WDAC/AppLocker to block or constrain mshta usage unless explicitly required"
