    "Place HTA-like content in an ADS to obscure the payload on disk",
    "PowerShell then starts mshta targeting the ADS path",

    "Detect via Sysmon file stream creation (EID 15) and mshta command lines referencing colon-delimited ADS paths",
    "Constrain ADS execution and disable or restrict mshta where operationally feasible"
