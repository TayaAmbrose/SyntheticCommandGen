  "explanation": "This pattern reflects Signed Script Proxy Execution by abusing PubPrn.vbs via cscript.exe from a PowerShell session. Adversaries may coerce the signed admin script into spawning an unintended child process, effectively proxying execution to bypass application control.",

    "Parent process is powershell.exe running under a standard user context.",

    "Command line shows unusual or non-standard arguments not typical for printer administration tasks (e.g., unexpected quotes, redirections, or network paths).",
    "A subsequent unexpected child process (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe, or rundll32.exe) spawns from cscript.exe.",
    "Event chain: powershell.exe -> cscript.exe -> PubPrn.vbs -> anomalous process indicates proxy execution."
