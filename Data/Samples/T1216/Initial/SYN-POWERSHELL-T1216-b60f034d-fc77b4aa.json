  "rationale_steps": [
    "PowerShell starts a signed Windows script host (mshta.exe), creating a trusted parent-child chain",
    "mshta loads a remote HTA resource, executing script content under a Microsoft-signed process",
    "This pattern often evades naive application control rules that trust signed hosts",
    "Defenders should monitor PowerShell spawning mshta with network destinations and HTA file indicators",
    "Harden via WDAC/AppLocker to block or constrain mshta usage unless explicitly required"
