    "Flag powershell.exe -> cscript.exe with prnport.vbs in command line.",
    "Look for non-standard port/printer arguments or embedded tokens.",
    "Child process from cscript.exe deviates from expected behavior (e.g., spawns an interpreter).",
    "No new ports/printers actually created per system logs.",
    "Execution originates from user space and not an installer/IT tool."
