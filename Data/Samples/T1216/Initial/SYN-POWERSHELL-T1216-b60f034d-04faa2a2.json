  "rationale_steps": [
    "PowerShell launches mshta with a script protocol payload rather than a file path",

    "Diskless execution can reduce on-disk IoCs and evade simple file-based controls",
    "Monitor for mshta with command lines containing script protocol tokens spawned by PowerShell",
    "Block or constrain mshta usage and enforce AMSI instrumentation where possible"
