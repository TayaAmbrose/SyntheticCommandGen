  "explanation": "Exfiltrates file content over ICMP on IPv6 using Nmap's nping, avoiding typical TCP/HTTP egress. The payload is Base64-encoded to make it less obvious in casual inspection, aligning with T1011 by using a different network medium (ICMP/IPv6) than standard channels.",

        "semantic_justification": "It reads and base64-encodes a file and attempts to send it as ICMPv6 payload via nping (aligning with automated exfiltration over an alternative medium), but it likely requires elevated privileges on Windows to craft/send ICMP and uses a single packet without chunking or retries, making it unreliable for typical file sizes.",
