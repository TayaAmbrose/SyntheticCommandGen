  "explanation": "Conceptually demonstrates T1011 by using an alternate network medium (IPv6 link-local) instead of the likely primary IPv4/HTTPS channel to exfiltrate data in base64 form over TCP to a non-standard port.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Select IPv6 link-local as the medium distinct from primary IPv4",
    "Base64-encode the target data to avoid binary anomalies",
    "Open AF_INET6/SOCK_STREAM and connect using a scope ID for the specific interface",
    "Send data to a high-numbered, uncommon TCP port",
    "Close the socket"
