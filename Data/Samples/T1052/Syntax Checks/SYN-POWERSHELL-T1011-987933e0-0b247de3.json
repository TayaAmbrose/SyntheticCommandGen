  "explanation": "Uses WMIC to spawn a hidden PowerShell that binds a TCP client to a Bluetooth PAN interface and sends a file to an external host over a high, uncommon TCP port. This aligns with T1011 by exfiltrating data via a network medium distinct from the primary LAN.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Identify a non-primary network medium (Bluetooth PAN) via WMI.",
    "Select the interface's IPv4 address and bind the socket to that address.",
    "Establish a TCP connection to an external host on an uncommon port.",
    "Transmit the selected file's bytes over that alternate medium.",
    "Avoid system-wide network changes; only the exfil process uses the alternate interface."
