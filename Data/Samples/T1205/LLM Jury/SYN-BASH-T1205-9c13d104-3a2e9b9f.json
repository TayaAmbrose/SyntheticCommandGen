  "explanation": "Builds a Wake-on-LAN magic packet in pure Bash (6x FF + 16x MAC) and broadcasts it via UDP/9 to wake the target system, enabling functionality for follow-on access. Root not strictly required to send a broadcast UDP, but some environments restrict broadcast; running as root aligns with raw socket and network constraints. Detection: log and alert on WoL-pattern UDP frames, especially if originating from servers that don't normally perform WoL.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Assemble the exact WoL frame with FF header and repeated MAC.",
    "Send via UDP broadcast to the standard WoL port 9.",
    "Wakes sleeping devices to re-enable reachable services.",
    "Use Bash and netcat; no exotic tooling.",
    "Detection: DPI signature for WoL; anomaly detection for broadcast spikes and out-of-profile senders."
