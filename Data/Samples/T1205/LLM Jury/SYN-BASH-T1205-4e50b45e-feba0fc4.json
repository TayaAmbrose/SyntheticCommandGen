  "rationale_steps": [
    "Generate UDP packets to ports 321, 654, 987 in order with minimal delay.",
    "Remote knockd detects the ordered UDP hits and triggers its open-command (e.g., iptables rule insertion).",
    "The opened service becomes reachable only to the knocking source IP.",
    "Blue teams can detect via netflow/pcap for repeated UDP hits on closed ports in tight timing windows."
