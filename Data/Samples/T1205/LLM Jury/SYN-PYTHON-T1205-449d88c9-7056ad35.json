  "explanation": "High-level concept: signal via IPv6 Hop-by-Hop extension headers to a specific address; the listener toggles routing or firewall behavior upon detection. Detection: log/drop unexpected IPv6 HbH headers at the edge, monitor sysctl changes, and alert on sudden enablement of forwarding or filter changes.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Capture IPv6 frames with scapy and check for IPv6ExtHdrHopByHop to a monitored destination.",
    "On detection, the logic would write to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and/or alter iptables (root-only).",
    "Detection: IDS rules for IPv6 HbH; system audit for forwarding toggles; SIEM correlation with network policy changes."
