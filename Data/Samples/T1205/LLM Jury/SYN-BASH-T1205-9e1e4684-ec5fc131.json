  "explanation": "Uses Scapy with root privileges to sniff for a UDP packet to port 54321 whose first 4 payload bytes equal 0xDEADBEEF. Upon seeing the magic packet, it launches an SSH SOCKS proxy (-D 1080) for covert comms. Detection: monitor for scapy/sniff usage by users; alert on UDP payload signatures; detect unexpected local SSH SOCKS proxies.",
