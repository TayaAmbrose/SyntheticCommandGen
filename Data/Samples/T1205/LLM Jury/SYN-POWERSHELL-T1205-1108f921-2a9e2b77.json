  "explanation": "Issues a DNS TXT query containing a magic label ('open-3389.example.com') to signal a controller that it's time to open RDP externally. This is a covert signaling channel consistent with T1205. Detection: inspect DNS egress for unusual labels encoding actions; monitor high-entropy or directive-like subdomains. No elevation required; UAC not triggered.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Use DNS as a signaling side-channel with an action-encoded label.",
    "Rely on a remote controller to react (e.g., adjust ACLs to open RDP).",
    "Recommend DNS logging and analysis for directive-like patterns."
