  "explanation": "Uses a sequence of ICMP echo requests with specific payload sizes as a covert knock to signal a remote listener to enable a service. No local privileges required to send. Detection: inspect ICMP patterns with unusual, small, sequenced sizes and correlate with service exposure events.",

    "Select a distinctive sequence of ICMP payload sizes (13, 37, 73).",
    "Emit single pings spaced closely to form a recognizable pattern.",
    "Remote sensor interprets the sequence to unlock a port.",
    "Traffic signaling avoids opening a dedicated control port.",
    "Detection: NIDS rules for ordered ICMP sizes; track post-knock connection success to new services."
