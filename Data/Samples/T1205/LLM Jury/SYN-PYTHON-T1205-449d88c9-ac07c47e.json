  "explanation": "High-level concept: a UDP magic packet with a cleartext passphrase signals the host to enable routing or NAT, effectively changing device functionality. Detection: monitor for UDP packets to odd ports with suspicious static payloads, alert on writes to net.ipv4.ip_forward and iptables NAT table modifications by root.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Use scapy to sniff for UDP packets to a chosen port and check Raw payload for a passphrase.",
    "On match, the logic would set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and add iptables NAT rules (requires root).",
    "Detection: sysctl/audit logs for ip_forward changes; iptables-save diffs; IDS payload matching on that UDP port."
