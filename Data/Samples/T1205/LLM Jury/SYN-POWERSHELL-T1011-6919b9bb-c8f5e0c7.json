  "explanation": "Exfiltrates file content over ICMP on IPv6 using Nmap's nping, avoiding typical TCP/HTTP egress. The payload is Base64-encoded to make it less obvious in casual inspection, aligning with T1011 by using a different network medium (ICMP/IPv6) than standard channels.",

        "semantic_justification": "While the approach of using Base64 encoded data over ICMPv6 via `nping` aligns with T1011's use of covert channels and non-standard protocols for traffic signaling, the 'None' privilege claim is incorrect as `nping.exe` typically requires administrator rights to send raw packets, and sending an entire file in a single ICMP packet is operationally implausible due to packet size limitations.",
