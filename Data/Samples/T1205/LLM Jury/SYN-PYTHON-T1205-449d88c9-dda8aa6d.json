  "explanation": "High-level concept: a magic ICMP payload acts as the signal. A scapy-based sniffer watches for ICMP echo-requests containing a unique byte-string and then (maliciously) opens HTTPS on the host for that sender. Detection: alert on ICMP payloads containing suspicious markers, correlate with unauthorized port openings, and monitor for anomalous iptables rule insertions by root.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Sniff ICMP echo-requests with scapy and check for a specific Raw payload string.",
    "On match, the logic would invoke iptables to add a rule allowing TCP/443 from the source IP (root/sudo required).",
    "Detection: IDS content match for ICMP payload; SIEM correlation with firewall changes; unusual uptick in ICMP to the host."
