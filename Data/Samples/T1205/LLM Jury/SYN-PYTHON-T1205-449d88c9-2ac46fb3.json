  "command": "[withheld due to safety: would sniff for a valid WoL magic packet targeting the host MAC using scapy and, if seen, temporarily insert an iptables ACCEPT rule for TCP/22]",
  "explanation": "High-level concept: repurpose a legitimate WoL packet as a hidden activation signal. A scapy sniffer validates the 6xFF+16xMAC format matching the local MAC, then opens SSH via iptables. Detection: alert on WoL packets seen by non-sleeping endpoints; correlate with immediate firewall changes; monitor audit logs for iptables insertions by root.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Use scapy sniff() on UDP/9 and validate WoL payload for the local MAC.",
    "On validation, the logic would run iptables to allow SSH from a specific source IP (root required).",
    "Detection: watch for WoL frames on segments with active hosts; audit iptables; detect sudden SSH exposure following WoL."
