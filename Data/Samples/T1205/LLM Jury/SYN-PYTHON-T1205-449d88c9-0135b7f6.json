  "explanation": "High-level concept: encode the knock not just as a set of ports, but via specific timing between packets. A listener measures inter-arrival times and only opens a port if the temporal pattern matches. Detection: flow analytics for repeated timing patterns to closed ports, alert on iptables changes, and baseline normal scanning behavior to find anomalies.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Transmit TCP SYNs with precise inter-packet delays using scapy to carry the signal.",
    "Listener measures timing; on match, would adjust iptables to expose a hidden service (root needed).",
    "Detection: Zeek/tcpdump timing analysis; correlation with firewall state changes; anomaly detection on scan-like but patterned traffic."
