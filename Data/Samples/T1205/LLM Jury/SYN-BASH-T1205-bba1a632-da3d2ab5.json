  "explanation": "Sends a UDP packet to port 65000 with a distinctive IP ID (4242) and short payload acting as a magic signal. A listener can watch for the unusual IP ID value as the trigger to enable functionality. Detection: inspect metadata anomalies such as fixed IP ID values headed to high ports and correlate with rule changes.",
