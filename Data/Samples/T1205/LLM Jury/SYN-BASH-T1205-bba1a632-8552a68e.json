  "explanation": "Sends a UDP port-knock sequence to 11111, 22222, and 33333 to act as a covert signal to a listening device to temporarily enable a service (e.g., open an administrative port). This does not require elevated privileges to transmit. Detection: correlate NetFlow/pcap for rapid hits to closed high ports from the same source and alert on defined knock sequences.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Generate a three-step knock sequence using nc to UDP ports.",
    "Rely on a listener on the network device to recognize the sequence and unlock a firewall rule.",
    "No privilege required to send; transmission is user space only.",
    "Detection: monitor for repetitive access attempts to uncommon ports and sequence-based anomalies."
