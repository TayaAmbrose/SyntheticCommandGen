  "explanation": "High-level concept: covert signaling via a DNS query to a specific domain. A scapy-based sniffer detects the query name and uses it as the trigger to (maliciously) open a service port. Detection: inspect DNS logs for suspicious trigger domains, alert on local firewall changes following such queries, and restrict local processes initiating iptables modifications.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Capture UDP/53 with scapy and parse DNS question names.",
    "If a pre-defined domain is observed, the logic would insert a permissive iptables rule for TCP/8080 (root/sudo needed).",
    "Detection: DNS telemetry for unusual or internal trigger domains; SIEM correlation with iptables changes; EDR watch for firewall-manipulating subprocesses."
