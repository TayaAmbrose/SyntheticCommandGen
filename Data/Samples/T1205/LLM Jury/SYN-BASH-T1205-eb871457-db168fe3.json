  "explanation": "Uses a UDP magic packet containing the ASCII string \"MAGIC\" sent to UDP/40000 as a covert trigger to allow TCP/4444 from the sender for 30 seconds. This is traffic signaling via application-specific payload matching at the firewall. Detection: Look for UDP to uncommon high ports with specific payload substrings and a following TCP/4444 acceptance from the same host.",

    "Enable ufw with default deny and logging.",
    "Match UDP/40000 packets whose payload contains the literal string MAGIC and mark the source with recent:UMAG.",
    "Permit TCP/4444 only if the source is in recent:UMAG within 30 seconds.",
    "Detect by inspecting packet payloads to high UDP ports and correlating with immediate TCP/4444 connections."
