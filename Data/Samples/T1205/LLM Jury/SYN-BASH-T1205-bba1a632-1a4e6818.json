  "explanation": "Enables Wake-on-LAN (WoL) on interface eth0 and sends a correctly formatted magic packet (six 0xFF bytes followed by the target MAC repeated 16 times) via UDP/9 to trigger a covert activation/wake signal consistent with traffic signaling. Elevated privileges are needed for ethtool; packet send uses nc. Detection: monitor for unusual UDP/9 traffic containing WoL signatures and audit ethtool configuration changes.",
