  "explanation": "Listens for a specific UDP magic packet (CA-FE-BA-BE-00-01) on port 49000. Upon receipt, it opens an inbound Windows Firewall rule for RDP (TCP/3389), enabling access only after the covert signal. Requires elevated PowerShell (UAC) because it modifies firewall rules via netsh.",

    "Open a UDP listener on a high port to await a secret magic packet.",
