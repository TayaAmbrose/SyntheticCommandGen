  "explanation": "High-level concept: encode the trigger in a DNS TXT query to blend with legitimate traffic. The listener reads the TXT payload and initiates a follow-on action like a reverse connection with nc. Detection: DNS logging to inspect TXT content, EDR monitoring for nc executions, and network monitoring for unexpected egress connections triggered by DNS.",

    "Use scapy to parse DNS queries and inspect TXT payloads for a specific token.",
    "If matched, the logic would spawn an nc client to connect back to the querier (privileges depend on port used).",
    "Detection: DNS content inspection; process creation telemetry; egress filtering and alerts for unexpected nc traffic."
