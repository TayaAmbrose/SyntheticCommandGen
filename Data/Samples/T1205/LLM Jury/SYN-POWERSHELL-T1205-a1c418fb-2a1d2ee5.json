The tool constructs the packet as 6 bytes of 0xFF followed by the target MAC repeated 16 times. Detection: monitor outbound UDP broadcasts to port 7/9 and process execution of WakeMeOnLan; review NetFlow and Sysmon (Event ID 3) for unusual magic packet bursts.",

    "As Administrator, ensure PowerShell is elevated if local firewall/UAC policies restrict broadcast sending.",
