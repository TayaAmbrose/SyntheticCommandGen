  "explanation": "Generates a TCP SYN-based port-knock sequence to 198.51.100.5 to trigger a hidden rule change on the remote host. No local root needed to send, but the effect is to enable a device function remotely via signaling. Detection: alert on sequential SYNs to non-service ports and sudden success on previously filtered ports.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Choose non-standard TCP ports for the knock pattern.",
    "Use netcat in zero-I/O scan mode to emit SYNs quickly.",
    "Maintain timing expected by the remote listener.",
    "Remote system uses the sequence as a magic trigger to open access.",
    "Detection: IDS for unusual SYNs to random ports; compare pre/post firewall accept logs."
