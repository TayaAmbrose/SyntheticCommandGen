  "explanation": "High-level concept: use an uncommon TCP flags combination as the activation signal. On seeing a packet with URG+PSH+FIN to a monitored port, malicious logic could spawn a local netcat listener to await a connection. Detection: IDS rules for rare TCP flag sets, process creation monitoring for nc, and network monitoring for unexpected listeners opening.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Use scapy to sniff TCP and inspect the flags field for a specific rare combination.",
    "On match, the logic would launch an nc listener on a chosen port (root may be required for privileged ports).",
    "Detection: Suricata/Snort signatures for unusual TCP flags; EDR alerts on netcat execution; netstat/lsof or Zeek to detect new listeners."
