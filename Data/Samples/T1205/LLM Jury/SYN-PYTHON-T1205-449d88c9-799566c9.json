  "explanation": "High-level concept: a port-knocking client emits a precise sequence of TCP SYN packets to closed ports to covertly signal a server-side listener. Upon recognizing the sequence, the listener would (if maliciously configured) insert an iptables rule to allow SSH from the knocker's IP. Detection: monitor for short-interval SYNs to closed/high ports in fixed sequences, correlate with subsequent iptables changes (auditd, /var/log/kern.log), and flag anomalous firewall modifications.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Craft and transmit a sequence of TCP SYN packets to closed ports using scapy (traffic signaling).",
    "Server-side logic matches the sequence within a time window and, if matched, would call iptables to open TCP/22 for the source IP (requires root/sudo).",
    "Detection: use tcpdump/IDS to alert on repeated SYNs to high ports in a pattern; audit iptables rule insertions; compare with baseline port state."
