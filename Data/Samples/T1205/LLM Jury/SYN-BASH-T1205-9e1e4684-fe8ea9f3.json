  "explanation": "Sends a sequence of UDP port knocks (11111, 22222, 33333) to signal a remote knock daemon/firewall to temporarily open SSH on port 4422, then immediately attempts an SSH connection. Detection: monitor for short, ordered bursts of UDP packets to high, normally closed ports; review firewall logs for repeated hits to uncommon UDP ports followed by new ACCEPT rules for an SSH port.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Generate a specific UDP knock sequence to signal a hidden service.",
    "Remote device updates its firewall to open SSH based on the observed sequence.",
    "Immediately connect via SSH to the now-open port to establish persistence.",
    "Detect by alerting on repeated, timed UDP hits to closed ports and sudden exposure of SSH ports."
