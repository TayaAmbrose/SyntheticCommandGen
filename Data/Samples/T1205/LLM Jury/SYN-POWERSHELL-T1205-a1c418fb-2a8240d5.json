  "explanation": "Manually crafts and transmits a WOL magic packet (6x 0xFF + 16x MAC) to the broadcast address, directly demonstrating Traffic Signaling mechanics without third-party binaries. Detection: inspect outbound UDP broadcasts to port 9, and consider NIDS signatures for the WOL byte pattern.",

    "Format the MAC address and construct the magic packet bytes per the WOL specification.",
    "Use UdpClient with broadcast enabled to send on UDP/9.",
