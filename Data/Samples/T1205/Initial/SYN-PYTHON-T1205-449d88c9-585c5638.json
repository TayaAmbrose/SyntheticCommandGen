  "explanation": "High-level concept: emit a standards-compliant WoL magic packet to trigger device wake or serve as a covert signal. The packet must be 6x 0xFF followed by 16x target MAC and can be broadcast to UDP/9. Detection: monitor for unusual WoL frames sent by unexpected hosts, alert on broadcast UDP/9 traffic with WoL payloads, and restrict who can send WoL in network policy.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Construct the WoL payload: FF FF FF FF FF FF + (MAC repeated 16 times).",
    "Send as Ethernet broadcast with UDP/9 using scapy (requires root to transmit raw frames).",
    "Detection: tcpdump filter udp port 9; IDS signatures for WoL payload; inventory which hosts are allowed to originate WoL."
