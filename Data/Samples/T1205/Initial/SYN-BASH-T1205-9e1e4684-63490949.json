  "explanation": "Uses Bash's /dev/udp pseudo-device to send three small UDP payload knocks (K1, K2, K3) to specific ports, signaling the remote host to open SSH on 4422, then connects. Detection: look for unusual use of /dev/udp in shell histories; packet inspection for small, ordered UDP payloads to uncommon ports; correlate with subsequent SSH connections from the same source IP.",

    "Issue three distinct UDP knocks using Bash's /dev/udp to minimize tool footprint.",
    "Remote knock service recognizes the payload sequence and opens SSH.",
    "Initiate SSH once the port is exposed.",
    "Detect by auditing shell history for /dev/udp usage and analyzing UDP-to-SSH correlation."
