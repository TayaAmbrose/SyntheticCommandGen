  "explanation": "Crafts and sends a Wake-on-LAN magic packet (6x FF followed by the MAC 16 times) via broadcast to wake a sleeping host, enabling it to accept subsequent connections. Requires root for raw packet send; typically performed via sudo if not already root. Detection: monitor for WOL frames (UDP/9 or UDP/7 with 0xFF*6 + MAC*16) especially outside business hours.",
