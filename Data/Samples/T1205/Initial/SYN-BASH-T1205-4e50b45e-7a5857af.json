  "explanation": "Sends a timed TCP port-knocking sequence to a host running knockd; upon correct sequence, the daemon can open a hidden service (e.g., SSH on 22) for the knocking source. Detection: correlate rapid connection attempts to closed/high ports from the same source and alert on knockd-triggered iptables changes.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Transmit TCP SYNs to ports 7000, 8000, 9000 with 200ms delay.",
    "Remote knockd matches the sequence and temporarily whitelists the source IP for a protected port (e.g., 22).",
    "User can then attempt a follow-on connection to the newly opened port.",
    "Defenders should monitor firewall logs for repeated hits on closed ports and sudden rule changes enabling new ports."
