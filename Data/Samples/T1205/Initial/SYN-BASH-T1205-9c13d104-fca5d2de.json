  "explanation": "Waits for three TCP SYNs to a decoy port (54321) and then opens TCP/2222 via iptables, using network traffic as the activation signal. Requires root for tcpdump on some interfaces and for iptables. Detection: alert on repeated SYNs to an unused high port and immediate firewall changes.",

    "Attach tcpdump with a filter for SYNs targeting TCP/54321.",
    "Count exactly three hits, suggesting a knock pattern.",
    "Upon threshold, insert rule to expose TCP/2222.",
    "Uses passive signaling without an always-open control port.",
    "Detection: monitor for abnormal SYNs to non-listening ports; log and alert on iptables -I insertions."
