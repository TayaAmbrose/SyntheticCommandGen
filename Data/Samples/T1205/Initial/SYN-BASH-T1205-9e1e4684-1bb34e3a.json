  "explanation": "Listens (requires sudo) for a single ICMP echo with magic identifier and sequence values (0xBEEF/0x1234). When observed, establishes a reverse SSH tunnel to a C2, effectively using the ICMP as a covert trigger. Detection: flag tcpdump invocation by non-admin users; IDS for ICMP packets with unusual id/seq patterns; monitor for unsolicited reverse SSH tunnels.",
