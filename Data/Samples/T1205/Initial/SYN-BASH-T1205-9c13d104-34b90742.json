  "explanation": "Sends a covert UDP port-knock sequence to 192.0.2.10 intended to signal a remote port-knocking daemon to temporarily open a filtered service (e.g., SSH). Requires no local privileges, but the remote reaction often modifies firewall state. Detection: monitor for short-burst UDP probes to uncommon sequential ports and correlate with immediate inbound ACL changes or new successful connections.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Define a knock sequence using high UDP ports 7000, 8001, 9002.",
    "Use netcat to transmit empty UDP datagrams (low-noise signaling).",
    "Space knocks with brief sleeps to match expected timing.",
    "Expect remote to open a hidden service upon correct sequence.",
    "Detection: NIDS rule for sequential UDP hits to closed ports; NetFlow for micro-bursts; alert on subsequent firewall rule changes."
