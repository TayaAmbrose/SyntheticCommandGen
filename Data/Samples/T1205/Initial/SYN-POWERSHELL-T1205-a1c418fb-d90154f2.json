  "explanation": "Implements TCP port knocking by attempting connections to a specific port sequence, potentially triggering a hidden service to open. Detection: watch for sequential connection attempts to uncommon, closed ports from the same source; leverage firewall logs (e.g., Windows Security 5156/5157) and IDS correlation.",

    "Define a three-port knock sequence on the target.",

    "Detect via correlation of sequential SYNs to unusual ports and firewall denied-connection events."
