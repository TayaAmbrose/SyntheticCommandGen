  "explanation": "Performs a UDP port-knocking sequence by sending empty datagrams to a predefined set of high ports. A remote knock daemon may open a hidden service upon receiving the correct sequence. Detection: correlate short-interval UDP hits to closed/uncommon ports; alert on repeated sequences from a single source. No elevation required; UAC not triggered.",
