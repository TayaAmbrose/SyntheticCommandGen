  "explanation": "Sends a UDP-based knock sequence likely to bypass stateful TCP monitoring; knockd can be configured to react to UDP patterns. Detection: watch for short-burst UDP probes to uncommon ports and validate against authorized knock sequences.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Generate UDP packets to ports 321, 654, 987 in order with minimal delay.",
    "Remote knockd detects the ordered UDP hits and triggers its open-command (e.g., iptables rule insertion).",
    "The opened service becomes reachable only to the knocking source IP.",
    "Blue teams can detect via netflow/pcap for repeated UDP hits on closed ports in tight timing windows."
