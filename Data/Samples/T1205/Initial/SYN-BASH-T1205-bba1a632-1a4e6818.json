  "explanation": "Enables Wake-on-LAN (WoL) on interface eth0 and sends a correctly formatted magic packet (six 0xFF bytes followed by the target MAC repeated 16 times) via UDP/9 to trigger a covert activation/wake signal consistent with traffic signaling. Elevated privileges are needed for ethtool; packet send uses nc. Detection: monitor for unusual UDP/9 traffic containing WoL signatures and audit ethtool configuration changes.",
  "rationale_steps": [
    "Set NIC to accept WoL magic packets using ethtool (requires sudo).",
    "Construct magic packet payload as hex and convert to binary with xxd.",
    "Send the packet via nc to UDP port 9 as the signaling trigger.",
    "Detection: IDS/pcap rules for six FF bytes + 16x MAC and change monitoring of ethtool wol settings."
