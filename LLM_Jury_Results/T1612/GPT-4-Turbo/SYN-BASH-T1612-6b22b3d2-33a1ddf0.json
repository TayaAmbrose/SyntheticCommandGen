The realism and technical plausibility are both very high due to the realistic usage of the Podman tool in a common architectural environment (Linux) and the technical feasibility of executing the command without elevated privileges. Maliciousness is also high due to the explicit intent to build a malicious image. However, the relevance of privileges is slightly lower as the command does not require elevated privileges.",
